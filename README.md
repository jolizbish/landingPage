# landingPage

Attached is a mockup of a landing page you need to convert to HTML.
The focus is on accessibility, cross-browser support, and page load speed.

Required:

 - it should work and look the same (as much as possible) in most modern browsers and devices (e.g. iPhone)
 - main background may change color (e.g. become green instead of blue)
 - "Even more savings" may be changed to a different copy
 - Form validation: not empty name, valid phone and email

Optional:
---------
 - additional form validation and enhancements of your choice
 - submit form content via ajax post to "https://formsws-hilstaging-com-k0mfqqpppw0s.runscope.net/solar".    Assume a valid 200 if you don't get one.

Optional:
---------
 - Additional form enhancements of your choice
 - JS unit tests
 - Any additional enhancements you would like to improve upon
